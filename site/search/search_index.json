My name is Brielle and I am a third-year J.D. student at the James E. Rogers College of Law. I am passionate about leadership, open science, and exploring creative solutions in the legal field. This website is a compilation of resources and insights I've developed to help others integrate open science practices into their work, especially in the legal field.      A little bit about me...      I obtained my bachelor\u2019s degree in Cognitive Science, with an emphasis in Neuroscience, from UC-Davis. I work closely with the Natural Resource Use and Management Clinic and faculty at the College of Law who are completing empirical research in various areas. After graduation, I will clerk for the Arizona Supreme Court before joining Kirkland and Ellis in San Francisco, working in their Intellectual Property Litigation group.      Currently, I'm participating in the University of Arizona's Roots for Resilience (R4R) program. The Roots for Resilience Program provides training and support to select graduate students on open, reproducible science and computational infrastructure tools to enhance research focused on resiliency in the environment. The Roots for Resilience research fellowship program in data science is led by the Arizona Institute for Resilience (AIR), CyVerse, and the Data Science Institute (DSI). For more information about these departments and programs, please visit the Additional Information Page located in the navigation bar on the left hand side of this page.      For more information about my previous experience, I encourage you to look over my Resume."},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>This page will contain contact information and potentially other resources.</p>"},{"location":"personalwebsite/","title":"Creating a Personal Website","text":"<p>This page will contain a \"how to\" on creating a personal website in Github.</p>"},{"location":"resources/","title":"Additional Resources","text":"<p>This page will include short blurbs about the resources at the UofA that I may mention throughout other pages on this website.</p>"},{"location":"open-science/","title":"What is Open Science?","text":"<p>\"Open Science is a collaborative and transparent approach to scientific research that emphasizes the accessibility, sharing, and reproducibility of data, methodologies, and findings to foster innovation and inclusivity\"</p> <p>-ChatGPT</p>"},{"location":"open-science/#what-tools-and-technologies-are-involved-in-open-science","title":"What tools and technologies are involved in open science?","text":"<p>There are a variety of different tools and technology available for use.
